# Bird
A website consiting of things such as bird phrases, like 
Birds of a Feather,  and A little Bird Told Me. 
Also included are origins of bird phrases and ways they have been used. 
In this project i used CSS flexbox and  CSS grid as well as Javascript to hide and show content and to create an array.

## CSS Features List:
* A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes
* Used Flexbox and CSS Grid
* Used  :nth-child to change the color of a paragraph


## Javascript
* Added the JS Array where an end user can input names of birds and then click show to read the names which were input. This is for the requirement: Create and populate a JavaScript array with one or more values and display the contents of some or all of the array on your page. 
* Added the,  press to hide or show content,  on main page to meet the requirement: Show/hide one or more content areas or elements on your site through clicking a button or some other user interaction - must be done with some JavaScript code. 

## Media Queries
* Must include a minimum of 2 media queries. I have added 3 media Queries. One media query changes the nav menu, from horizontal to vertical, when viewed at smaller screens. One media query is set to keep the two buttons (for input and show on the array page) together even when viewed at smaller screens. And one media query changes the layout on the main page to make it viewable at different screen sizes. 

## Git Hub Commits
* Surpassed the minmum of 5 commits. Currently at 74 commits.
