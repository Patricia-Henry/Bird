            <h2>For the Birds</h2>
            <p>
              This phrase, That's for the Birds, is of American origin and,
              while still in use there, has never been commonly used elsewhere.
              It is US Army slang and originated towards the end of WWII. An
              early example of its use is this piece from The Lowell Sun,
              October 1944, in an interview with a Sergt. Buck Erickson, of Camp
              Ellis, Illinois: - The Phrase Finder
            </p>

              "Don't take too seriously this belief that we have football at
              Camp Ellis solely for the entertainment of the personnel - that's
              strictly for the birds. The army is a winner... the army likes to
              win - that's the most fortunate thing in the world for America."

            <p>
              Messenger birds and pigeons may have been the source for this
              phrase. It has been used in the Holy Bible too, Ecclesiastes
              10:20. John Heywood explained a slightly different version in 1562
              which was edited again in 1906.  The birds warned him that Regin
              would kill him. Sir Richard Wagner also used birds instructing him
              to steal a helmet and ring through a small song. The communication
              of and with the birds is speculated as a source of origin or at
              least popularity of the phrase. - Source: theidioms.com

            <h2>Birds of A Feather</h2>
            <p>
              Have you ever heard the phrase “birds of a feather flock
              together”? If you’ve ever watched birds in nature, you know that
              the saying holds true. If you see a flock of birds flying
              together, it’s made up of the same kind of birds.
            </p>
            <p>
              A proverb is an old saying that’s considered to be wise or good
              advice. “Birds of a feather flock together” has been around in the
              English language since the mid-1500s.

              This proverb refers back to medieval falconry where a bird in the
              hand (the falcon) was a valuable asset and certainly worth more
              than two in the bush (the prey).
            </p>

            <!-- <p>
              The first citation of the expression in print in its currently
              used form is found in John Ray’s A Hand-book of Proverbs, 1670, in
              which he lists it as: A [also ‘one’] bird in the hand is worth two
              in the bush By how long the phrase predates Ray’s publishing isn’t
              clear, as variants of it were known for centuries before 1670.
